        <h2 class="navy">Carrier Goals</h2>
        <p class="light-navy">My current short-term goal is to develop and use my marketing
            and communications skills in a job like this one.
            However, I eventually want to develop into a position that
            allows me to continue to use these skills while also managing a marketing group.
            I will prepare for this goal by taking on leadership positions in team projects,
            and by developing my professional career through attending
            leadership conferences such as the one put on annually by your company.</p>
        <div>
            <h3 class="navy" ><b>Work Experience</b></h3>
            <p class="light-navy" >I have some strong work experience that will help me with this job if I am successful.
                I worked for a year as a student in a local Pizza restaurant.
                That helped me to get confidence in talking to the public,
                and also showed me that this is a job where I will need to work hard.
                I then worked for a short while in a kitchen, helping the chef.
                That showed me the other side of working in a restaurant,
                so I can understand the importance of giving the chef accurate information with orders.
                I also worked for a while in a bank.  That shows that I am confident with handling money,
                which will help when I take payment for meals.
